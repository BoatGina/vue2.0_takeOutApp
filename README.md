### Summary from me 
Hi,guys! I am a student,stuggling to learn web font-end.This is a slightly small project that I practice vue2.0. 
Maybe this project is easy ,but actually I gained a lot . By learning  source codes from others and reading 
a lot of offical technology documents, I have learned how to use and configure  vue2.0+webpack2.0 , axio , vue-router
 , css-preprocessor and so on. I am quiet familiar with the development of mobile. When making this project , 
 I met some bugs and I found Webstorm editor is helpful to solve those bugs thought the prompt.
